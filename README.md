Studying perturbations in the gut ecosystem using animal models of disease continues to provide valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in various physiological conditions. However, understanding whether these changes are consistent across different animal models, and hence potentially translatable to human populations remains a major unmet challenge. Nonetheless, in relatively limited cases have the same interventions been studied in two animal models in the same laboratory. Moreover, such studies typically examine only one data layer and single time-point. Here, we show the power of integrating longitudinal microbiome and metabolome data in identifying features that relate two different mouse models of atherosclerosis: ApoE and Ldlr knockouts (ApoE-/-; Ldlr-/-), under conditions of intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia (IHH), a model for human obstructive sleep apnea. Using Random Forest classifiers trained on each data layer, we show excellent accuracy values in predicting IHH-exposure within ApoE-/- and Ldlr-/- mice, and in cross-applying predictive features found in one animal model to the other.  Some key microbes and metabolites that were top predictors of IHH-exposure across animal models included bacterial species from the order Clostridiales, muricholic acid (bile acid) and vaccenic acid (fatty acid), providing a refined set of biomarkers reproducibly associated with this intervention. The results highlight that different animal models of disease can be related to one another using supervised machine learning techniques, especially when time series multi-omics data are available and provide a pathway towards identifying robust microbiome and metabolome features that underpin translation from animal models to understanding human disease.

IMPORTANCE Reproducibility of microbiome research is a major topic of contemporary interest. Although it is often possible to distinguish individuals with specific diseases within a study, the differences are often inconsistent across cohorts. Here we study the same intervention in two different mouse models of a cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis) by profiling the microbiome and metabolome in stool specimens over time. We demonstrate that shared microbial and metabolic changes are involved in both models on intervention. We then introduce a pipeline for finding similar results in other studies. The results will help find common features identified across different model systems, which are most likely to apply to humans.
